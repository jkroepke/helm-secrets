## [Unreleased]
### Added
- `--ignore-missing-values` Support for evaluating secret references (`vals` backend) in helm templates (requires helm 3.9.0; vals 0.20+)

### Fixed
- Performance issues with large value files (vals backend)
- Remote value file download fails when URL contains query strings

## [4.2.2] - 2022-11-20
### Fixed
- Performance issues with large value files

## [4.2.1] - 2022-11-14

## [4.2.0] - 2022-11-08
### Added
- `--ignore-missing-values` (`HELM_SECRETS_IGNORE_MISSING_VALUES`). This option allows ignoring errors related to file not found.
- if paths or value files beginning with a `?` in beginning, all file not found errors related to that specific value file are ignored.
- Support for shell installed via scoop

### Fixed
- Multiple values in a single --set option not correctly passed to helm
- `cat: can't open '/dev/stdin': No such file or directory` on Windows

## [4.1.1] - 2022-09-21
### Fixed
- Fix handing of special character `\` from literal `vals` values
- Remove escape character `\` from literal `vals` values, if value contains quotes.

## [4.1.0] - 2022-09-20
### Added
- Support for literal `vals` values like `--set`, `--set-string` and `--set-json`, e.g. 
  - `--set auth.rootPassword=ref+vault://secret/mysql#/rootPassword`
- Support for literal `vals` values through downloader syntax `secrets+literal://`, e.g. 
  - `--set-file secrets+literal://ref+vault://secret/mysql#/rootPassword`

## [4.0.0] - 2022-09-11
### Added
- Support for decrypting files defined via `--set-file`

### Changed
- **Breaking**: Rename `helm secrets dec` to `helm secrets decrypt`
- **Breaking**: Rename `helm secrets enc` to `helm secrets encrypt`
- **Breaking**: The `decrypt` and `encrypt` command write the results to stdout now. Both commands support `-i` flag to en/decrypt file in-line. 
- **Breaking**: Secret drivers are renamed to secret backends
  - This is **breaking** custom integrations. All shell functions contains the name `driver` are renamed to `backend`, e.g.: `driver_encrypt_file` -> `backend_encrypt_file`
  - The CLI Arguments `--driver`, `-d` and `--driver-args` has been renamed to `--backend`, `-b` and `--backend-args`
  - The environment variables `HELM_SECRETS_DRIVER` and `HELM_SECRETS_DRIVER_ARGS` has been renamed to `HELM_SECRETS_BACKEND` and `HELM_SECRETS_BACKEND_ARGS`

### Removed

- `helm secret terraform` command. The `helm secret decrypt --terraform` command is a drop-in replacement.
- `helm secret view` command. The `helm secret decrypt` command is a drop-in replacement.
- `vault` driver. The `vals` driver supports vault as backend, too.
- `envsubst` driver. The `vals` driver supports envsubst as backend, too.
- `droppler` driver.
- `sops://` protocol handler
- `secret://` protocol handler

  As alternative, you can use `secrets+gpg-import-kubernetes://` to import a gpg key from an existing kubernetes secret, but it requires the kubectl command.
  Checkout the [docs/ARGOCD.md](docs/ArgoCD Integration.md) for more information.
